One of the highlights of the scenery is the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport (VAAH), which is the main airport serving Ahmedabad and Gujarat. The airport is named after the first Deputy Prime Minister of India and a prominent leader of the Indian independence movement. The airport has two terminals, one for domestic flights and one for international flights, and handles over 11 million passengers annually.
 
The scenery recreates the airport with high accuracy and detail, using custom-made 3D models, textures, and animations. The airport features realistic ground markings, taxiways, runways, aprons, gates, jetways, and signs. The airport also has dynamic lighting, custom vehicles, static aircraft, and animated traffic. The scenery also includes the nearby landmarks such as the Motera Stadium, the world's largest cricket stadium.
 
Another highlight of the scenery is the photoreal terrain, which covers the entire state of Gujarat with high-resolution satellite imagery. The terrain is enhanced with accurate landclass and waterclass data, which define the types and distribution of land and water features such as forests, farms, rivers, lakes, and coastlines. The terrain also has custom autogen and night lighting, which add realistic buildings, trees, roads, and lights to the scenery.
