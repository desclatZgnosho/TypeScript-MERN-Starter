## What is a Warlock in Torchlight 2?
 
A Warlock is a type of Embermage that focuses on using fire and dark magic to damage and debuff enemies. Warlocks can also summon skeletons, imps, and other creatures from the nether realm to aid them in combat. Warlocks are excellent at dealing area of effect damage, crowd control, and survivability.
 
Warlocks have three skill trees: Inferno, Frost, and Storm. Inferno skills are mainly fire-based and deal direct damage or burn enemies over time. Frost skills are mainly ice-based and slow down or freeze enemies. Storm skills are mainly lightning-based and stun or shock enemies. While all three skill trees have some useful skills for a Warlock, the Inferno tree is the most important one to invest in.
 
## How to Build a Warlock in Torchlight 2?
 
To build a Warlock in Torchlight 2, you will need to allocate your stat points and skill points wisely. Here are some general guidelines to follow:
 
- Stat points: As a caster, you will want to focus on increasing your Focus and Vitality. Focus increases your mana pool and your spell damage, while Vitality increases your health pool and your armor. You can ignore Strength and Dexterity, as they are not very useful for a Warlock.
- Skill points: As mentioned before, the Inferno skill tree is the most important one for a Warlock. You will want to max out skills such as Blazing Pillar, Firestorm, Immolation Aura, Infernal Collapse, Death's Bounty, and Elemental Boon. These skills will provide you with high damage output, mana regeneration, damage reduction, and buffs. You can also invest some points in the Frost skill tree for skills such as Frost Phase, Hailstorm, Elemental Attunement, and Frost Wave. These skills will provide you with mobility, crowd control, debuffs, and additional damage. You can ignore the Storm skill tree entirely, as it does not offer much for a Warlock.
- Equipment: As a Warlock, you will want to equip items that boost your Focus, Vitality, spell damage, mana regeneration, fire damage, and elemental damage. You can use any type of weapon that suits your preference, but staves are usually the best option for casters. You can also use rings, amulets, belts, gloves, boots, helmets, chest armor, shoulder armor, and pants that have these stats. You can also look for items that have sockets or enchantments that enhance your stats or skills.
